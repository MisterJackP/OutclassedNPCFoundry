saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes
no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only
half damage if it fails.
Actions
Multiattack. The enlightened master makes four
enlightened strikes.
Enlightened Strike. Melee Spell Attack: +13 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d12 + 7) bludgeoning
damage. If the target is a creature, the enlightened
master can choose one of the following additional effects.
The target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving
throw or drop one item it is holding (enlightened
master's choice).
The target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution
saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned
until the end of the martial arts master's next turn.
Reactions
Reflect Missile. When the enlightened master is
targeted by a ranged weapon or spell attack, roll a d6.
On a roll of 1-3, the attack hits, but can't critically hit 
the enlightened master. On a roll of 4-6, the attack 
misses. In either case, the attacker  must make a DC 21
Wisdom saving throw, taking 13 (2d12) force damage
on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one.
