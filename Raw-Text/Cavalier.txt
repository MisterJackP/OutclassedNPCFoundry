Charger. If the cavalier moves at least 20 feet in a
straight line towards a creature and then hits it with a
lance attack, the creature takes an additional 6 (1d12)
piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 14
Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Saddle Master. Mounting or dismounting  a creature
costs 5 feet of movement for the cavalier. It has
advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off
its mount, and if it falls, it can automatically  land on its
feet if it falls less than 10 feet and isn't incapacitated.
Actions
Multiattack. If the cavalier is mounted, it can make two
lance attacks. These attacks cannot be made against
the same target.
Reactions
Warding Maneuvers. When a creature the cavalier can
see targets the cavalier or its mount with an attack, the
cavalier adds 2 to the AC of both itself and its mount
against attacks from that creature until the start of the
cavalier's next turn.
