Countercharm. While playing music, the one hit wonder
and allied creatures that can hear it within 30 feet of it
have advantage on all saving throws and are immune
to the frightened and charmed conditions.
Bardic Inspiration (1/Turn). As a bonus action, the one
hit wonder chooses an ally that can see and hear it
within 30 feet of its position. In the next minute, the
target can add 1d12 to one ability check, attack roll, or
saving throw of its choice. Once a target has benefited
from this feature, it must finish a short or long rest
before it can benefit from it again.
