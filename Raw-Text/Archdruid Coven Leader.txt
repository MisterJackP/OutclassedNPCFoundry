Change Shape (2/Day). The archdruid magically
polymorphs into a beast or elemental with a challenge
rating   of 6 or less, and can remain in this form for up to
9 hours. The archdruid can choose whether its
equipment falls to the ground, melds with its new
form, or is worn by the new form. The archdruid
reverts to its true form as a bonus action or if it is
knocked to 0 hit points, with excess damage carrying
over to its true form. While in a new form, the
archdruid retains its game statistics and ability  to
speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution are replaced by those of
the new form, and it gains any special senses,
proficiencies, traits, actions and reactions  (except class
features, legendary actions, and lair actions)  that the
new form has. It can cast its spells with verbal or
somatic components s in its new form (marked with an
asterisk*). The new form's attacks are magical.
