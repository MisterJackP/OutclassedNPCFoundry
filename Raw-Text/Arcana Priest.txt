Actions
Abjure the Supernatural (Recharges after a Short or Long
Rest). One celestial elemental, fey, or fiend the priest
can see within 30 feet of it that can see and hear the
priest must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw
or become frightened by the priest. While it is
frightened, it cannot take actions or reactions and
must use its movement to move as far away from the
priest as it can. The target can repeat the save at the
end of its turn if the priest isn't in line of sight, ending
the effect on a success.
