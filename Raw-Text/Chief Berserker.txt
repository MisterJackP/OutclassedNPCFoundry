Look at Me. I'm the Chief Now. When the chief
berserker is killed, one berserker ally within 30 feet of
the berserker can magically and permanently adopt
the chief berserker's statblock. The berserker ally
retains its hit points and its equipment.
Reckless Rally. At the start of its turn, the chief
berserker can gain advantage on all melee weapon
attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against it
have advantage until the start of its next turn.
Berserker allies within 30 feet of the berserker also
have advantage on the first attack they make on their
next turn against any creature the berserker attacked 
with its reckless trait active this turn.
Unarmored Defense. While not wearing armor, the
barbarian's AC includes its Constitution modifier.
