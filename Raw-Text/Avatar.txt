Divine Intervention (Recharges after a Long Rest). As a
bonus action , the avatar can cast any spell with a
casting time of one action from the cleric spell list
without expending a spell slot or components, even if
the spell isn't on its prepared spell list or if it has
already cast a spell on its turn. After doing so, the
avatar regains all of its expended spell slots.
Spellcasting. The avatar is a 20th-level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 19, +11 to
hit with spell attacks). It has the following cleric spells
prepared.
Cantrips (at will): light, mending, sacred flame, spare
the dying, thaumaturgy
1st level (4 slots): command, cure wounds, guiding
bolt, purify food and drink, shield of faith
2nd level (3 slots): lesser restoration, spiritual weapon,
zone of truth

Actions
Turn Undead (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The
avatar presents its holy symbol and speaks a prayer.
Each undead that can see or hear the avatar must
make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. If the target is an
undead of CR 4 or lower, it is destroyed on a failed
save. Otherwise, on a failed save the target is turned
for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned
creature moves up to its speed away from the avatar
and can't willingly move within 30 feet of it. It can't
take reactions and must either use the Dash action or 
try to escape from an effect that stops it from moving.
If it can't move, it can take the Dodge action.
