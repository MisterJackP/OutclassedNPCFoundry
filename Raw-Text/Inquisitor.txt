Eye for Detail. The inquisitor has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks.
Sneak Attack (1/Turn). The inquisitor deals an extra 10
(3d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon
attack and  has advantage on the attack roll, or when
the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the inquisitor
that isn't incapacitated and the inquisitor doesn't have
disadvantage on the attack roll. The inquisitor also
doesn't need advantage if it has detected the presence
of deceptive magic from its target creature using its
Unerring Eye.
Unerring Eye (3/Day). The inquisitor can use a bonus
action to sense the presence of illusions,
shapechangers not in their original form, and other
magic designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of
it, provided it isn't blinded or deafened. The inquisitor
senses only the presence of these effects, not their
form.
