Actions
Turn Undead (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The
cardinal presents its holy symbol and speaks a prayer.
Each undead that can see or hear the cardinal must
make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. If the target is an
undead of CR 3 or lower, it is destroyed on a failed
save. Otherwise, on a failed save the target is turned
for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned
creature moves up to its speed away from the cardinal
and can't willingly move within 30 feet of it. It can't
take reactions and must either use the Dash action or 
try to escape from an effect that stops it from moving.
If it can't move, it can take the Dodge action.
