Loyal Goons. When the mastermind is targeted by an
attack and an ally is within 5 feet of it, the
mastermind's ally can use its reaction to swap places
with the mastermind, and the ally becomes the target
instead.
Master of Tactics. The mastermind can use the Help
action as a bonus action. When used to assist an ally in
attacking a creature, the target of the attack can be
within 30 feet of the mastermind.
Sneak Attack (1/Turn). The mastermind deals an extra
14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon
attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when
the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the mastermind
that isn't incapacitated and the mastermind doesn't
have disadvantage on the attack roll.
Soul of Deceit. The mastermind's thoughts can't be
read by telepathy or other means. The mastermind can
present false thoughts by succeeding on a Charisma
(Deception) check contested by the mind reader's
Wisdom (Insight) check. Additionally, the mastermind
is unaffected by magic that would compel it to tell the
truth; instead, such magic always indicates that the
mastermind is truthful.
