Actions
Stein Mace. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage. If the rune scribe scores a critical hit, the target is knocked prone. This is a magic weapon that ignores resistances and immunities to bludgeoning damage.
Indomitable Stand. The rune scribe scratches the Stein Rune with a chisel into the ground at its feet. Until it moves, it gains advantage on all ability checks and saving throws that would force it to move, and it can force a creature that moves within 10 feet of its position to succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or have its movement speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.
Stone's Secrets. The rune scribe scratches the Stein Rune with a chisel into a stone wall or floor. It learns the location and size of any creatures touching the surface within 30 feet of its position at the moment it completes the rune.
