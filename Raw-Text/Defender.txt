Actions
Multiattack. The defender makes one melee weapon attack. If the attack misses, the defender can immediately use its shield bash against the same target.
Spear. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
Handaxe. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

Mace. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
Shield Bash. The defender bashes its shield against a creature within 5 feet of it. The target makes a DC 12 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed 5 feet away.
Reactions
Protection. When a creature attacks a target other than the defender within 30 feet of the defender, and the defender can see them both, the defender can move up to its speed. If it ends this movement within 5 feet of the target of the attack, the defender can impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
