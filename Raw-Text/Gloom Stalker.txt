Actions
Multiattack. On the first turn of combat, the gloom
stalker makes two attacks with its darts.
Dagger. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
reach 5 ft., or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 +
3) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage.
Dart. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., 
one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 5
(2d4) poison damage, and the target must succeed on
a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned
by the darts for 1 hour. If the target fails this save by 5
or more, it is also unconscious while poisoned in this
way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or another
creature takes an action to shake it awake.
Reactions
Shadowy Dodge. When a creature targets the gloom
stalker with an attack, the gloom stalker can use its
reaction to impose disadvantage on that attack.
