Mage Slayer. The templar has advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creatures within 5 feet of its position. Additionally, when the templar damages a creature concentrating on a spell, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes to maintain concentration. 
Actions
Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands.
Reactions
Spell Breaker. When a creature within 5 feet of the templar casts a spell, the templar can make a melee weapon attack against that creature. The templar's attack hits before the spell is cast. The target must make a Constitution saving throw as though it were maintaining concentration on the spell. On failed save, the target fails to cast the spell.
