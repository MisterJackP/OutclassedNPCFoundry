Darkness Incarnate. The sorcerer can cast darkness at
will as a bonus action without expending verbal or
material components.
Douser of Light. Natural fires and other light sources
not worn or carried by a creature are magically
extinguished when the sorcerer starts its turn within 30
feet of them. While not in direct sunlight, the sorcerer
can choose to magically appear as a black silhouette, granting it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A
DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check exposes the sorcerer's
true appearance (but doesn't reveal the sorcerer if it is
hidden).
Innate Spellcasting. The sorcerer's spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The sorcerer can cast the following spells innately.
At will: chill touch, false life, minor illusion, sleep
3/day each: blindness/deafness, disguise self, fear, ray of sickness
1/day each: blink, circle of death, invisibility
Undead Fortitude. If damage reduces the sorcerer to 0
hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw
with a DC of 5 plus the damage taken, unless the
damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success,
the sorcerer drops to 1 hit point instead.
Actions
Sickle. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage.
Summon Hound of Ill Omen (1/Day). The sorcerer
summons a hell hound from the Nine Hells to an empty
space within 30 feet of it. The hell hound is fiercely
loyal to the sorcerer and remains in the material realm
for 1 minute or until the sorcerer dismisses it as an
action.
