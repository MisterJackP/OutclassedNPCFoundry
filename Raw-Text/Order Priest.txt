Order's Demand. Each creature of the priest's choice within 30 feet of the priest must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or immediately drop an item they are holding (priest's choice) and become charmed by the priest until the end of the priest's next turn or until the charmed creature takes damage. While charmed in this way, a creature views the priest as the ultimate determiner of what is right and wrong.
