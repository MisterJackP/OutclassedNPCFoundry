Words of the Spirit. When the astral projector speaks, it can make its voice be heard up to 600 feet away. Alternatively, it can choose only certain creatures it can see within 30 feet of it to be able to hear its words.
Mind Body Split. When the astral projector is reduced to 0 hit points, it can separate its spirit from its body, dying and becoming two creatures: the astral spirit and body puppet. The body puppet dies if the astral spirit dies or if it starts its turn further than 600 feet from the astral spirit.
