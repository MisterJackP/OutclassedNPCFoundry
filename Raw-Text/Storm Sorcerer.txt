Breath of the Wind. The sorcerer doesn't trigger
opportunity attacks when it flies out of a hostile creature's reach.
Conductor of the Wind. The sorcerer can use its bonus
action to change the direction of the wind within a
100-foot radius around it. The sorcerer can choose the
direction but not the strength of the wind.
Innate Spellcasting. The sorcerer's spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). The sorcerer can cast the following spells innately.
At will: gust, shocking grasp, thunderclap, thunderwave
3/day each: gust of wind, shatter, thunderous smite
1/day each: call lightning, storm sphere, warding wind, wind wall
Actions
Lightning Dagger. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6
to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4
(1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) lightning
damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16
Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end
of its next turn. This is a magic weapon.
Reactions
Wind's Lash. When the sorcerer is hit by an attack, it
can use its reaction to force its attacker to make a DC
16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
target takes 14 (4d6) thunder damage and is pushed 20
feet in a direction of the sorcerer's choice. On a
successful save, the target takes no damage and is
pushed 10 feet.
