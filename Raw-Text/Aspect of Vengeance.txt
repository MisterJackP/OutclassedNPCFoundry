Aura of Courage. The aspect and friendly creatures
within 30 feet of it can't be frightened while the aspect
is conscious.
Sacred Weapons. The aspect's weapon attacks  are
magical. When the aspect hits with its maul, the
weapon deals an extra 18 (4d8) radiant damage
(included in the attack).
Vow of Enmity (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). As
a bonus action, the aspect targets a creature it can see
within 10 feet of it. The aspect always knows in which
direction its target can be found, and the aspect has
advantage on attack rolls against the creature until the
creature dies or the aspect chooses another target.
Actions
Multiattack. The aspect uses its Abjure Enemy, if it can.
It then makes three attacks with its maul.
Abjure Enemy (Recharge 5-6). The aspect targets a
creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The creature
must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, and the
creature has disadvantage on its save if it is a fiend or
undead. On a failed save, the the creature is frightened
for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While
frightened, the creature's speed is 0, and it can't
benefit from any bonus to speed. On a successful save,
the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until it
takes any damage. This action has no effect on
creatures immune to being frightened.
