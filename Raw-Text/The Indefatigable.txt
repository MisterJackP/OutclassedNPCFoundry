Action Surge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The
indefatigable can take one additional action on its turn.
Disarming Attack (1/Turn). When the indefatigable hits
a creature with a melee attack, it can deal an additional
6 (1d12) damage and force the target to succeed on a
DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or drop a weapon or
object of the indefatigable's choice that it is holding.
Duelist. As a bonus action, the indefatigable can force
one creature it can see within 30 feet of it to make a
DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
target has disadvantage on attack rolls made against
creatures other than the indefatigable and can't
willingly move further away from it. These effects end
at the start of the indefatigable's next turn.
Additionally, the indefatigable gains a +2 to damage
rolls when it hits with its legendary longsword when
wielded with one hand (included in the attack).
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). When the indefatigable
fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Magic Armor. The indefatigable's  plate mail and shield
are both magical, contributing to a +3 increase in AC
each while the indefatigable wears them.

on a roll of 18-20.
Survivor. The indefatigable regains 20 hit points at the
start of its turn if it isn't incapacitated.
Weapon Bond. The indefatigable can summon its
legendary longsword to its hand or banish it to a demiplane as a bonus action. The indefatigable can't be
disarmed of this weapon unless it is incapacitated.
Actions
Multiattack. The indefatigable makes four attacks with its legendary longsword.
