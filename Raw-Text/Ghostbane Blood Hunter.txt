Beyond Death. When the blood hunter is reduced to 0 hit points, it falls unconscious and its spirit rises from its body. Its spirit is a ghost that replaces its actions with only the Rite Scythe attack. If the blood hunter dies, its spirit also dies, and vice versa. If the spirit reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the blood hunter regains 9 (2d8) hit points. The blood hunter's spirit immediately returns to its body if the blood hunter wakes up by any means.
Hunter's Bane. The blood hunter has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, and undead, and on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.
