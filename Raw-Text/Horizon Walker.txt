Distant Strike. When the horizon walker takes the Multiattack action, it can teleport up to 10 feet before
or after each attack to an unoccupied space it can see.
Ethereal Jaunt. As a bonus action, the horizon walker
can magically shift from the Material Plane to the
Ethereal Plane, or vice versa.
Actions
Multiattack. The horizon walker makes three attacks with its subtle knife. Each attack must be against a
different target.
Subtle Knife. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5
ft.,  one target. Hit: 13 (1d4 + 2d8 + 2) force damage.
On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as
with the astral projection spell), the horizon walker can
cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its
material body, instead of dealing damage. This is a
magic weapon.
Detect Portal (3/Day). The horizon walker magically
detects the direction and distance to the nearest
planar portal or planar gash (a small hidden connection between worlds, a potential planar portal) on the same
plane of existence as it.
Open Portal. The horizon walker targets a hidden
planar gash with its subtle knife, creating a one-way
portal to a randomly-determined plane of existence.
The portal stays open until the end of the horizon
walker's next turn; the horizon walker can use its
action to keep the portal open.
Reactions
Spectral Defense. When the horizon walker takes
damage from an attack, it can give itself resistance to
the damage of the attack.
