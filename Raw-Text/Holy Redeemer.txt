Emissary of Redemption. The redeemer's resistances
don't function against creatures it has attacked or
targeted with a spell since the last dawn.
Spellcasting. The redeemer is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting  ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to
hit with spell attacks). It has the following paladin
spells prepared.
1st level (4 slots): compelled duel, cure wounds,
protection from evil and good, sanctuary, sleep
2nd level (2 slots): calm emotions, hold person, lesser
restoration
Actions
Multiattack. The redeemer makes two attacks with its staff.
Sacred Staff. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5
ft.,  one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If
the target is an evil-aligned creature, the attack deals
an additional 9 (2d8) radiant damage.
Reactions
Protect the Innocent. When a creature within 30 feet of
the redeemer takes damage, it can use its reaction to
magically take that damage instead. The redeemer
doesn't transfer any other effects that might
accompany the damage, and this damage can't be
reduced in any way.
Rebuke the Violent. When the redeemer sees an
attacker within 30 feet of it deal damage with an attack
against a creature other than the paladin, it can use its
reaction to force the attacker to make a DC 15
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker 
takes radiant damage equal to the damage it just dealt.
On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.
