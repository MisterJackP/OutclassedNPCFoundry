Calming Touch. The tranquil master touches a creature
that is at its hit point maximum. The creature must
succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or lose its
ability to attack  for 1 minute. During that period, it also
cannot cast spells that deal damage or that force a
target to make a saving throw. The effect ends if the
target is attacked, takes damage, or is forced to make a
saving throw.
Healing Hands. The tranquil master touches a willing

Pool. Alternatively, the tranquil master can spend 5 hit
points from its pool to cure one disease or one poison
afflicting the target. The tranquil master has a pool of
20 hit points it can draw from to use its Healing Hands
action. It replenishes the pool when it completes a long
rest.
