Hunter's Sense (3/Day). As a bonus action, the monster
hunter examines a creature it can see within 60 feet of
it, discerning whether the creature has any damage
immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what
they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, it senses that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities.
Innate Spellcasting. The monster hunter's spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell
attacks). It can cast the following spells innately,
without expending material components.
3/Day each: absorb elements, chromatic orb, detect
magic, detect poison and disease
1/Day each: fog cloud, protection from evil and good
Slayer's Prey. As a bonus action, the monster hunter
designates one creature it can see within 60 feet of it
as its prey. The first time on the monster hunter's turn 
that is hits its prey with a weapon attack, the prey takes an extra
7 (2d6) damage from the weapon.
Actions
Multiattack. The monster hunter makes two melee
attacks.
Adaptive Halberd. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing damage (the monster hunter's
choice). This is a magic weapon.
Heavy Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing
damage.
Reactions
Slayer's Counter. When the monster hunter's prey
forces it to make a saving throw, the monster hunter
can use its reaction to immediately make one weapon
attack against the prey, which it makes before the
saving throw. If the attack hits, the monster hunter
automatically succeeds on the saving throw against the
prey's effect.
