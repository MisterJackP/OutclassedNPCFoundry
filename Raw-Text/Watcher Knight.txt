Abjure the Extraplanar (1/Day). Each elemental, fey, fiend, or aberration  within 30 feet of the knight that can hear it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the knight as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of the knight. For its action,  it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
Divine Sense (3/Day). Until the end of the knight's next turn, it knows the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of it that is not behind total cover. It knows the type of creature but not its identity.
