Bearer of Resolve. Allied creatures that can see the
standard bearer have advantage on saving throws
against being frightened.
Innate Spellcasting. The standard bearer's innate
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to
hit with spell attacks). It can cast the following spells,
requiring no material components.

Saddle Master. Mounting or dismounting a creature
costs 5 feet of movement for the standard bearer. It
has advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling
off its mount, and if it falls, it can automatically land on
its feet if it falls less than 10 feet and isn't
incapacitated.
Actions
Multiattack. The standard bearer makes two attacks 
with its pike or its longsword.
Reactions
Hold the Line. When a creature moves at least 1 foot
while within 5 feet of the standard bearer (or within 10
feet while it wields its pike), the standard bearer can
make an opportunity attack against that creature. If it
hits, the creature's speed is reduced to 0 until the end
of its turn.
