Actions
Multiattack. The Swarm makes two attacks  with its writhing vortex.
Writhing Vortex. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d6 + 4) bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (The Swarm's choice).
Storm of Minions (Recharge 5-6). The Swarm summons a 30 ft. radius sphere of enraged swarming minions centred on a point it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (6d8) necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded. The Swarm is unaffected by its storm of minions. The Swarm is healed by the total amount of damage dealt.
Legendary Actions
The Swarm can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options  below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Swarm regains spent legendary actions  at the start of its turn.
Swarm Splitter. The Swarm summons a swarm of insects (or another type of swarm) by sacrificing a number of hit points equal to the total hit points of the summoned swarm. The summoned swarm appears in an unoccupied or occupied space within 5 feet of The Swarm.
Swarming Tide. The Swarm moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
