Guerilla Fighter. The scout has advantage on initiative checks. The scout can ignore the limitation of 1 use of
sneak attack per turn if each use of it is against a
different surprised enemy and as long as the
requirements for sneak attack are otherwise met.
Sneak Attack (1/Turn). The scout deals an extra 10 (3d6)
damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and
has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is
within 5 feet of an ally of the scout that isn't
incapacitated and the scout doesn't have disadvantage
on the attack roll.
