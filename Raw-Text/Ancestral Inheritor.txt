Ancestral Demise. When the inheritor dies, it
disintegrates and becomes an ancestral spirit, joining
the other ancestral spirits as they pass on to guard one
of the inheritor's children chosen at random. If the
inheritor has no children, it dies, along with all of its
ancestral spirits.
Ancestral Protectors. In battle, the inheritor is
surrounded and protected by ancestral spirits, the
souls of its ancestors. The first time the inheritor hits a
creature with a melee weapon attack on its turn, the
creature becomes the target of the ancestral spirits,
hindering its attacks. The target has disadvantage on
attack rolls until the start of the inheritor's next turn.

ancestral spirits, reducing the damage by 7 (2d6)
