Beyond Death (2/Day). When the zealot is reduced to 0
hit points by an attack that isn't a critical hit, and the
zealot is not killed outright, it can choose to fall to 1 hit
point instead.

Reckless. At the start of its turn, the barbarian can gain
advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that
turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start 
of its next turn.
Actions
Multiattack. The zealot makes two attacks with Dawn
Star.
Dawn Star. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., 
one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, plus 7
(2d6) radiant damage. Additionally,  if the target is a
creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving
throw or begin shedding bright light in a 10 foot radius
and dim light for 10 feet beyond that. The glowing light
grants advantage on attack rolls against the target, and
it lasts until the start of the target's next turn. This is a
magic weapon.
