Aura of Treachery. The mortal traitor has advantage on
melee attack rolls against any creature that has one or
more of its allies within 5 feet of it.
Deceitful Nature. The mortal traitor can use its bonus
action to turn invisible until the end of its next turn or
until it attacks, deals damage, or forces a creature to
make a saving throw. Additionally,  the mortal traitor
can choose to ignore the disadvantage imposed by
heavy armor when it makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check.
Actions
Multiattack. The mortal traitor makes two attacks with its flail.
Flail. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 18
(4d8) poison damage.
Reactions
Treacherous Strike. If a creature within 5 feet of the
mortal traitor misses it with a melee attack, the mortal
traitor can magically force it to reroll that attack against
a creature of its choice that is within 5 feet of the
attacker. This reaction  fails if the attacker is immune to
being charmed.
