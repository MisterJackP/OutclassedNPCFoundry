Evasive Maneuvers. When the martial arts master is
subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity
saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes
no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only
half damage if it fails.
Unarmored Defense. While the martial arts master is
wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC
includes its Wisdom modifier.
Actions
Multiattack. The martial arts master makes four
unarmed strikes.
Unarmed Strike. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
This is a magic weapon attack. If the target is a
creature, the martial arts master can choose one of the
following additional effects.
The target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving
throw or drop one item it is holding (martial arts
master's choice).
The target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving
throw or be knocked prone.
The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution
saving throw or be stunned until the end of the
martial arts master's next turn.
Improvised Missile. Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit,
range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4)
bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (depending
on the nature of the missile thrown).
Reactions
Deflect Missile. In response to being hit by a ranged
weapon attack, the martial arts master deflects the
missile. The damage it takes from the attack  is reduced
by 15 (2d10 + 4). If the damage is reduced to 0, it
catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one
hand and a hand is free. It can then make an
improvised missile attack.
