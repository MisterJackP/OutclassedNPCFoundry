Invisible Hand. The thief gains additional benefits when
it casts mage hand. For a creature to notice the hand or
the tasks the hand is performing, it must succeed on a
Wisdom (Perception) check:
The hand created by the spell is invisible.
The thief can use the hand to stow or retrieve one
object into or from a container worn or carried by
another creature, or to use its Thieves' Tools.
The thief can use its bonus action to control the
hand, or to distract a creature within range of the
spell. If it distracts a creature, it gains advantage on
attack rolls against the target until the end of the
thief's turn.
Sneak Attack (1/Turn). The thief deals an extra 10 (3d6)
damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and
has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is
within 5 feet of an ally of the thief that isn't
incapacitated and the thief doesn't have disadvantage
on the attack roll.
