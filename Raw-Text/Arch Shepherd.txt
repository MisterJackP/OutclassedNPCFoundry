Actions
Animal Aura (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest). The
arch shepherd chooses a point within 60 feet that it
can see and calls forth an aura with a 30-foot radius
around that point. The arch shepherd can move the
aura up to 60 feet to a point it can see as a bonus
action. The aura persists for 1 minute or until the arch
shepherd is incapacitated. The aura has one of the
following effects:
Bear Aura. Each creature in the aura when it appears
gains 14 (4d6) temporary hit points and has
advantage on Strength checks and saving throws
while in the aura.
Hawk Aura. When a creature in the aura makes an
attack roll, the arch shepherd can use its reaction to
grant advantage on that roll.
Unicorn Aura. An allied creature that starts its turn in
the aura gains 3 (1d6) hit points.
Before or after taking the Animal Aura action the arch
shepherd can cast a spell with a casting time of one
action.
