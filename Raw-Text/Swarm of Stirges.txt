Blood Drain. At the start of each of its turns, the swarm drains the blood of one creature within its space. The creature loses 10 (4d4) hit points due to blood loss, or 5 (2d4) hit points if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
Swarm. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny stirge.  The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
