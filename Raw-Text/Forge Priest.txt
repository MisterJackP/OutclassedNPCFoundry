Hammer of the Divine Forge. Melee Weapon Attack: +7
to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5)
bludgeoning damage, plus 9 (2d8) fire damage, and the
target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving
throw or ignite in flames. At the start of each of the
target's turns, the target makes another Constitution 
saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) fire damage on a failed
save, or ending the effect on a success. The effects end
when the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an
action to put out the flames, or if some other effect
douses the flames. This is a +1 magic weapon.
