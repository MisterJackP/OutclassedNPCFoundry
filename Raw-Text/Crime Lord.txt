Evasive. When the crime boss is targeted by an effect
that forces the crime boss to make a Dexterity saving
throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no
damage if it succeeds and half if it fails.
Elusive. No attack  roll has advantage against the crime
boss while it isn't incapacitated.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). When the crime boss
fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Loyal Goons. When the crime boss is targeted by an
attack and an ally is within 10 feet of it, the crime
boss's ally can use its reaction to swap places with the
crime boss, and the ally becomes the target instead.
Master of Tactics. The crime boss can use the Help
action as a bonus action. When used to assist an ally in
attacking a creature, the target of the attack can be
within 30 feet of the crime boss.
Sneak Attack (1/Turn). The crime boss deals an extra 42
(12d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon
attack and has advantage on the attack, or when
the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the crime boss
that isn't incapacitated and the crime boss doesn't
have disadvantage on the attack roll.
Actions
Multiattack. The crime boss makes two attacks with its rapier.
Rapier of Warning. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing
damage. This is a magic weapon. While the crime lord
is attuned to the rapier, the crime lord has advantage
on initiative rolls and can't be surprised.
Reactions
Uncanny Dodge. The crime lord halves the damage that
it takes from an attack that hits it. The crime lord must
be able to see the attacker.
