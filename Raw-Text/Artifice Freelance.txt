Bandolier. The freelancer carries 10 pieces of ammunition for its hunting  rifle and 3 of each type of grenade it can use. It can replenish its hunting rifle ammunition after completing a short rest using its smith's tools.
Shield of Missile Attraction. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of the freelancer, the freelancer becomes the target instead.
Tinker's Shield. The freelancer's shield is held by a mechanical frame and arm attached to its back. The freelancer does not require a free hand to benefit from its shield.
Actions

Hunting Rifle. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/240 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage. The freelancer must spend an action to reload this weapon attacks.
Fragmentation Grenade. The freelancer throws the grenade at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
Smoke Grenade. The freelancer throws the grenade at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. The grenade emits a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily-obscured area in a 20-foot radius. A moderate wind (10 mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds, and a strong wind (20 mph) disperses it in 1 round.
