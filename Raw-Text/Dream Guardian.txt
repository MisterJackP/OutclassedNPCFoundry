Moonlight Hearth. During a short or long rest, the
dream guardian touches a point in space, and an
invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears,
centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.
While within the sphere, the dream guardian and its
allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and
Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open
flames in the sphere isn't visible outside of it. The
sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when the
dream guardian leaves the sphere.
