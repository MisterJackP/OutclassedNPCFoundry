Crossbow Specialist. The bounty hunter ignores the loading property of crossbows, and it has a +2 to attack rolls made with its heavy crossbow (included in the attack).
Follow Prey. The bounty hunter has advantage on checks to track a target, and its passive Perception is increased by 5.
Tracker's Mark. As a bonus action, the bounty hunter chooses one target within 60 feet of its position that it can see, or replaces its mark with a new target it can see within range. The bounty hunter's weapon attacks ignore any damage resistances of the marked target and deal an additional 7 (2d6) damage.
Tripwire Specialist. The bounty hunter incurs no disadvantage on ranged attacks made against targets that are prone, and when it reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a ranged weapon attack, it can choose to knock the creature unconscious and stabilise them rather than kill them.
Actions
Multiattack. The bounty hunter makes two attacks with its heavy crossbow.
Heavy Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
Restrain. The bounty hunter attempts to restrain a prone creature within 5 feet of its position. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity or Strength saving throw (its choice) or become grappled and restrained by the bounty hunter (escape DC 14).
Reactions
Distance Keeper. When a hostile creature ends its turn within 5 feet of the bounty hunter, the bounty hunter can move up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
