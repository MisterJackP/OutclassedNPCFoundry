# OutclassedNPCFoundry

This is a Foundry Virtual Tabletop https://foundryvtt.com implimentation of most of 'OUTCLASSED: The NPC Statblock Compendium' by William Rotor https://www.dmsguild.com/product/302037/OUTCLASSED-The-NPC-Statblock-Compendium, an _excellent_ homebrew collectiom of DnD 5e's classes and subclasses as non player characters, balanced against other NPCs and creatures and simplified to be easily playable as a DM, without losing their flavour. 

It was created using https://github.com/jbhaywood/5e-statblock-importer, with some further manual tweaks and edits by me within Foundry. It was originally a personal project, so some errors and ommisions will have been made. No art for characters or abilities are currently included.

Adding it to your game is simple, just add the 'outclassed-npcs.db' file into the 'FoundryVTT/foundry/Data/worlds/<YOUR GAME WORLD NAME>/packs' folder. Upon loading Foundry, it should then appear in game in the compendium tab, and the entries can be drag and dropped into your world.
